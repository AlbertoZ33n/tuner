TUNER - An enveloping sampler with 4 (stereo) wavetable crossfading and two independent panels 

- LIBRARIES: 
Grid from "Unauthorized" library (Pd Extended it's fine)

- How to play: 
on startup the patch loads four+four default samples. Activate the start/stop dsp button
and start moving the "TUNER" control in the center of the patch. This gives
more weight to each of the four samples. With the control in the middle all samples 
are mixed together. If you move the second slider on the right the second set of samples
are activated now. Simple, isn't it?

There is the possibility to manually load a set of four samples, and you can do it 
while the other panel is active. For example, if the left panel is active load 4 sample
on the right panel (and don't forget to resynch after loading if needed!).  
 
The name "Tuner" comes from the fact that if you load four "independent" samples and 
you crossfade between them the effect is like an old tuner..

All samples come from the freesound project (http://www.freesound.org/). In particular:
